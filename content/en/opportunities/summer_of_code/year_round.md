Unlike summer and winter of code programs, these initiatives can be repeated at various times of the year or started at any point.

### [Linux Foundation Mentorship Program](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/mentorship-programs/)
LFX is designed to help developers by providing them with the skills and resources needed to learn, experiment, and contribute effectively to open-source communities. There are various mentorship programs that can be undertaken at various times of the year.

### [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/)
Internship programs in open source and open science intended for underrepresented groups in the tech industry. There are two internship periods: December-March and May-August.

### [X.Org Endless Vacation of Code (EVoC)](https://www.x.org/wiki/XorgEVoC/)
A program very similar to Google Summer of Code but that can be undertaken at any time of the year. Projects typically last 3/4 months and require a nearly full-time commitment.
