### [University of Amsterdam, Master of Logic](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/)

The [Master of Logic](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/) is THE academic program
for lovers of the discipline. It grants easy access to an academic career in
such field. Brouwer, Heyting, and Beth all studied in Amsterdam. When coming
from Bologna's bachelor's degree in Informatics, you will be exempted from
taking _Mathematical Proof Methods for Logic_ and _Complexity Theory_. If you
pick as an elective _Metodi logici per la filosofia_, you will also be
(unreasonably) exempted from _Introduction to Modal Logic_, too. Because of
this, if you pick the _Logic and Computation_ track, you will only have two
mandatory courses: _Logic, Language, and Computation_ and _Information Theory_,
which add up to only 9 ECTS. All other courses can be freely chosen from
[a long list of options](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2023-2024-en/search-programme/programme/7711/255187).
You can pick courses from different fields, including Philosophy or Languages,
or focus exclusively on mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. An
academic mentor (offer from your same academic background) will help you choose
through the whole two years, but the choice is always up to you.

The program offers to its students small study rooms reserved to students of
the _Master of Logic_. They are open 24/7, and one of them features external
monitors. Professors will also talk about their recent work during each
courses, so current research and teaching walk hand in hand.

This program also have its own flaws, though: there is almost no Free
Software/Linux culture, with very few exceptions. Even if a handful of courses
feature some programming/assisted proofs (Logical Verification, Computational
Social Choice, Parallel Algorithms (MasterMath), Knowledge Representation and
Reasoning, Functional Programming, Automated Planning, Game Theory, Type Theory,
...), you may not necessarily be interested in all of them. Still, it is
possible to register and get credits for courses from other programs (e.g., the
popular [_Master Computer Science_](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/computer-science/computer-science.html))
or universities (potentially in different cities).
